This website is something I really wanted to have since I saw a blog website for the first time. A website where I can do anything I want.. share my personal thoughts, experience, technology, music or anything I like. Sure, I am not a writer, but I will write in plain English ðŸ˜œ</p>\n<!-- end -->\n<h2>First love with technology ðŸ’¾</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg\">salted duck eggs</a></p>\n<p>When I got my first smartphone (yes! it was a dream ðŸ’¤), I used to tweak it in every way and do a lot of crazy stuffs. And, I came across many guides and tutorials on XDA-developers and other websites, where I knew a lot about android. My first experience changing the ROM of my android smartphone was really great! I don't know exactly when, but since then I really like technology.</p>\n<h2>My first job! ðŸŽ‰</h2>\n<p>After graduating from college, I moved to city for a job, so that I can stand on myself. But at that time, as I was a fresher and being not from technical background, it was really difficult for me to find a job... any kind of job really. Then, I got back to home, when I had two back-to-back life-screwing incidents. And, then I realized life is not easy, it never was.</p>\n<p>I had 2 interviews from which I cracked one and... got my first job! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ It was kinda technical sales and support kind of job, but anyway I got a reason to move forward. I met a whole bunch of people and learned a lot from them. The company was a digital marketing company, so I got to know a lot about websites, how they are built, how search engines work, and I swear, I was really pumped about it!</p>\n<h2>The switch!</h2>\n<p>After a year doing support and sale stuffs, I bought my laptop, with the help of my parents, and started learning about the web. I learned HTML, CSS and was doing some designs on Adobe XD. Then, I switched my job as a UI Developer, and hell yeah! I was doing the work I really like doing!</p>\n<p>The work was nothing related to programming, but I like playing with browser developer tools and doing things that I can actually see and be happy about. I was designing UIs, and converting them to a working website. And, that was great!! Then, I started learning more.. JavaScript is the first language I chose for obvious reasons and still love it!</p>\n<h2>The work I do</h2>\n<p>My work is still with browsers, code editors, developer tools, terminal, but its more advanced that it was. Now I am focused as a Front-end Developer, working with JavaScript primarily, still HTML, CSS, but as JSX, Sass and so much more than I ever imagined. I still like to design and still trying to be pixel perfect. There is still a whole lot of things I don't know yet! And I am constantly trying to improve my skills and add more to the bucket list ðŸ˜€</p>\n<h2>Plans??? ðŸ˜•</h2>\n<p>Life is still not easy! And I am still trying to figure it out, everyday. I don't know, and probably you also, how tomorrow will be and what it can do. So, it's better do what you love, think positive and do overpass yourself everyday! May be you will someday overpass your expectation.</p>\n<p>So, don't know if I will always be a Front-end Developer, but as long as its with computers and software or anything that excites me.. I'm gonna do that!</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"My first blog on my website","date":"May 22, 2020","description":"Hello, welcome to my website.
