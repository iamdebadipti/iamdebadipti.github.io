I know, I am writing this in a really crazy time, but this is my first ever blog about me that I have posted online so this is really exciting for me. While we are all stuck at home, it's a really good excuse to let you know, who am I? and what I do? and, why this website exist at all? If you want to follow me or see what I am up to, you can find me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamdebadipti\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/iamdebadipti\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/p-debadipti/\">LinkedIn</a>. I spend most of my time on Twitter, for the memes 🙌; so please follow me on there, I swear I will not bloat you timeline 😉.</p>\n<h2>😎 About me</h2>\n<p>As you may already know, my name is Debadipti Patra, yup.. I know it's not the most memorable name you have ever heard, but really?? do you ever have to remember my name?🤔 Before jumping into my post, it is worth noting that I am very bad at writing. But I swear, I will write everything in plain and simple English 😬.</p>\n<p>I am a self-taught Software Engineer (Front-End Developer), from a very small village of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha\">Odisha</a>, which is also known as the temple state of India. Currently I am working with some amazing and talented people in Bangalore. You know, being from a Management background, it is a little bit hard to get into Software Engineering, and I did not started programming also when I started my career. But, it is my passion for technologies, and some amazing peoples' help that got me this far, and I am forever grateful to them 😇.</p>\n<h2>💪 My Work</h2>\n<p>Now, I mostly work on Front End technologies like, JavaScript, <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React.js</a>, <a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/\">GraphQL</a>, <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">React Native</a>, SCSS, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>, but also recently started working on the Back End with <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a>, <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/\">MongoDB</a>, other cool technologies and tools. Back when I was starting to learn to code, I was doing some research and study in UI/UX design, and this is now helping me to design and develop pixel-perfect websites and web apps 😁.</p>\n<p>Recently, I have started working on my side-projects. One of the major work I have started is a blogging website, <a href=\"https://www.crazynerd.tech/\">CrazyNerd</a>, where I am posting all about technology, be it programming, open source software (as I am a Linux fan boy 😎), or anything I love and excited about 🤩. Another project I am working on is a small note taking web app, where you can save, sync and share notes written in markdown or normal text format. I have also made my first NPM module <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-dark-hook\">use-dark-hook</a> 🙌 🙌 which will help you to integrate dark mode in your React Web App.</p>\n<p>You can find all my work on <a href=\"https://github.com/iamdebadipti\">GitHub</a> 👈.</p>\n<p>Besides programming, I love music 🎧 and taking pictures of nature 📸. My favorite kind of music is Lo-Fi Beats which helps me focus and relax while coding 😌. And, my favorite sport is playing badminton which I usually play in weekends, but trying to make it an everyday game in my schedule.</p>\n<p>It is not been a long time I started programming, but I am sure I will continue to develop more and more amazing stuff in the future 🙃, and learn a whole lot of thing along the way. To be frank, even I am not sure where it will take, but I am enjoying every bit of this journey 😇.</p>\n<p>I am glad you survived till the end of this long 😬 ... whatever this thing is. Again, no judgements please, I know my English. I will post my experience, opinions, and probably other things here in my blog, so.... have you not followed me yet? Here is my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamdebadipti\">twitter handle</a>, in case you are searching.</p>\n<p>Anyways, thank you so much reading! 🙌 🙌</p>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World!","date":"June 06, 2020","description":"Welcome to my website 🤗.
