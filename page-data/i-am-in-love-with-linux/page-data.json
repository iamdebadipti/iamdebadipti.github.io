Let's just accept the reality here. It is simple, elegant looking, have great touchpad, display, animations, software availability and all that good stuff. And, if you are looking for something to get your work done, then sure, go for it! or even Windows (except the fact that you don't care about your privacy 😜). But, the problem is everything about MacOS is so good, that it doesn't let its users change anything in it, ANYTHING! Of course you can change the wallpaper, what are you talking about!! 🤷‍♂️</p>\n<p>I have started using computers with Windows installed on it! And that time any other operation system didn't came to my mind! Like it was the norm - using a Windows computer. I bought my first laptop with Ubuntu installed on it. I immediately installed Windows, obviously cracked one 😅. But, after using for 3-4 months, I started hating it from inside! As I always seek for different things in life, I tried looking for different OS, and stumbled upon Linux, tried it, failed at first try, and that intrigued me to know more about it.</p>\n<p>Finally I have installed Linux Mint, an Ubuntu based clean and fantastic Linux distribution. Then, I have tried several other options, and finally tried Arch Linux. I remember, it was @3am in the morning, and after so many tries, Arch finally booted up! It was just the bare UI, but it was nothing less than an achievement 🍾🍺🎉.</p>\n<p>I started learning more and more about how Linux, or a operation system in general work. I fell in love with the terminal. I tweaked every bit of it! But, still I consider myself a noob 🤓, because there is still so much more to know about Linux. I try, fail, succeed! And this very part is keeping me in love with Linux ❤️.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"I am in love with Linux 💛","date":"August 07, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-am-in-love-with-linux/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World!"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1546467933","2297725318","462027165"]}
